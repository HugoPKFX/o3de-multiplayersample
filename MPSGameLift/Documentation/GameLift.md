# MultiplayerSample Project with Amazon GameLift

This README covers optional setup, testing and running on [Amazon GameLift](https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift/), an AWS service to make hosting and scaling game servers easier. 

## Running with [Amazon GameLift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/index.html)

### Setup
1. Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), if you don't already have it. You will need it to interact with Amazon GameLift.

    a. Confirm installation by running `aws --version`
    ```sh
    C:\> aws --version
    aws-cli/2.10.0 Python/3.11.2 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off
    ```
1. Work in progress (WiP) step: Add your AWS region to Config/default_aws_resource_mappings.json (example: "Region": "us-west-2")

    a. Currently needed otherwise when the client initializes GameLift there will be an error about not having a region.

    b. This step will be removed once we properly parse the game-session data which contains the fleet-id, region-id, etc  

1. Use Export Project to Compile Code and Build Assets

    ```sh
    <path-to-o3de-engine>\scripts\o3de.bat export-project -es <path-to-multiplayer-sample>\MPSGameLift\Scripts\export_gamelift_server_package.py --code --assets -ll INFO
    ```
    ---
    **Important**

    The export_gamelift_server_package script only works for projects built using engine source, and won't work with engine as an sdk.

    ---
It's important to make sure that the bootstrap.game.profile.setreg file has been added to one of the seed files. (also add debug if you want to support debug builds)

1. Create the Launcher Zip file
   Use the following .bat file or equivalent copy steps to create a directory with the launchers in it:
   Run from MultiplayerSample project root directory...
   ```sh
    rem Use this by calling 'make_release C:\GameLiftPackageWindows' to make a release directory
    mkdir %1
    mkdir %1\Cache
    mkdir %1\Cache\pc
    mkdir %1\Gems
    mkdir %1\Gems\AWSCore
    
    rem Copy the pak files
    copy .\AssetBundling\Bundles\*.pak %1\Cache\pc
    
    rem Copy the executables and DLLs
    copy .\build\windows_mono\bin\profile\*.* %1
    
    rem Copy launch_server.cfg
    copy .\launch_server.cfg %1

    rem Copy the AWSCore files
    copy .\build\windows_mono\bin\profile\Gems\AWSCore\*.* %1\Gems\AWSCore
    ```
1. Test the profile pak server and game locally
    Run the server in headless mode using `rhi=null` and `NullRenderer` parameters; the server appears as a white screen in headless mode.
    
    `C:\GameLiftPackageWindows\MultiplayerSample.ServerLauncher.exe --rhi=null -NullRenderer -bg_ConnectToAssetProcessor=0 -sys_PakPriority=2 --console-command-file=launch_server.cfg`
    
    `<path-to-multiplayer-sample>\build\windows\bin\profile\MultiplayerSample.GameLauncher.exe -bg_ConnectToAssetProcessor=0 --connect`

    ---
    **NOTE**

    Launch_server.cfg is required because there's a bug with multiplayer when calling --loadlevel in the command-line. See https://github.com/o3de/o3de/issues/15773.

    ---

1. Open C:\GameLiftPackageWindows\user\log\Server.log
    You should see the "New Starbase" level loaded
    ```
    Entities from new root spawnable 'levels/newstarbase/newstarbase.spawnable' are ready
    ```

## Prepare for GameLift
### Upload the build to GameLift

---
**NOTE**

Builds are tied to Fleets; you may want to delete the existing build and fleet via the AWS Gamelift dashboard just so you don't accidentally reference old builds or old fleets in future steps.

---
 
```sh
aws gamelift upload-build --operating-system WINDOWS_2016 --build-root C:\GameLiftPackageWindows\ --name MultiplayerSample --build-version v1.0 --region us-west-2
```
Record BuildId for the next step. Example: build-fe4a2b2c-8ae5-4757-99a6-0ff372d03512

### Create Fleet
After running this command it'll take about an hour for the fleet to activate. Check the status on the GameLift dashboard. 

```sh
aws gamelift create-fleet --region us-west-2 --name GameLiftO3DTest2016 --ec2-instance-type c5.large --fleet-type ON_DEMAND --build-id <BuildId> --runtime-configuration "GameSessionActivationTimeoutSeconds=300, MaxConcurrentGameSessionActivations=2, ServerProcesses=[{LaunchPath=C:\game\MultiplayerSample.ServerLauncher.exe, Parameters= --rhi=null -sys_PakPriority=2 -NullRenderer -sv_terminateOnPlayerExit=true -bg_ConnectToAssetProcessor=0 --sv_gameLiftEnabled=true --sv_dedicated_host_onstartup=false --console-command-file=launch_server.cfg, ConcurrentExecutions=1}]" --ec2-inbound-permissions "FromPort=33450,ToPort=34449,IpRange=0.0.0.0/0,Protocol=UDP"
```
---
**NOTE**

The ec2-instance-type and fleet-type determines the kind of AWS resources used; your AWS account may incur costs.

---

Record the FleetId for the next step. Example: fleet-1a49fc3e-892a-40fc-b2e9-aa7e11983182

### Create and Join Game Session
```sh
aws gamelift create-game-session --region us-west-2 --fleet-id <FleetId> --name foogamesession1 --maximum-player-session-count 3
```
Record GameSessionId for the next step. Example: arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::gamesession/fleet-1a49fc3e-892a-40fc-b2e9-aa7e11983182/gsess-4745e6ab-6cc0-44c7-b78d-acab9534f206

Launch the game client with:
```sh
./build/windows/bin/profile/MultiplayerSample.GameLauncher.exe --loadlevel="mpsgamelift/prefabs/GameLiftConnectJsonMenu.spawnable"
```
```sh
aws gamelift create-player-session --region us-west-2 --game-session-id <GameSessionId> --player-id Player1
```
---
**NOTE**
PlayerId passed into create-player-session shouldn't be the player id passed into these JSON block; keep these unique. 
Record PlayerSessionId and use this in the game immediately because it expires after 60 seconds. Example: psess-50311090-9283-4fb0-ad1a-94468e60fa16

---

Paste in the game session and player session and click Connect. 
```json
{ "GameSessionId": "<GameSessionId>", "PlayerId": "player_id", "PlayerSessionId": "<PlayerSessionId>" }
```
